2) JobSchedulerDemoðŸš€- This app is an Android application that schedules a background task to fetch API data when the device is connected to a Wi-Fi network and the battery is not low. The app uses the JobScheduler API to define and schedule a job with these specific conditions. The ApiJobService class handles the job execution, fetching the data in the background using an AsyncTask. The job is scheduled in the MainActivity when the app starts, ensuring that it runs under the specified conditions and persists across device reboots.
