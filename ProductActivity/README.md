# ViewModelFactory Demonstration [code](https://github.com/Ace1032/AndroidFundamentals/blob/main/ProductActivity/app/src/main/java/com/example/productactivity/MainActivity.kt)

This project demonstrates the importance of ViewModelFactory for initializing ViewModels with 
dependencies in an Android application. The example includes a ViewModel, ViewModelFactory, 
and a Repository.

### Explanation
MainActivity
The MainActivity serves as the entry point of the application. It initializes the ProductViewModel
using ViewModelProvider and a custom ProductViewModelFactory. This setup ensures that the
ProductViewModel is created with the required dependencies, such as ApiService and DataBase.

## ProductViewModelFactory
The ProductViewModelFactory is a factory class that creates instances of ProductViewModel with 
the necessary dependencies. This factory class accepts the required dependencies 
(like ApiService and DataBase) through its constructor and provides them to the ProductViewModel
when it is instantiated. The use of ViewModelFactory ensures that the ViewModel is initialized 
properly and that all dependencies are injected correctly.

## ProductRepository
The ProductRepository is responsible for handling data operations. It requires instances of ApiService
and DataBase to perform its tasks, such as fetching data from a remote API or accessing the local 
database. By using a repository, the data management logic is decoupled from the ViewModel, promoting
a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

## ProductViewModel
The ProductViewModel manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious manner. It depends on the 
ProductRepository to fetch and store data. By delegating data operations to the repository, the 
ViewModel can focus on preparing and managing data for the UI, ensuring that the UI remains responsive 
and up-to-date.

## DataBase
The DataBase class simulates a database component that requires a context for initialization. 
This class represents the local data storage layer of the application, providing methods to
access and manipulate data stored locally.

## ApiService
The ApiService class simulates an API service component that interacts with remote servers 
to fetch or send data. This class encapsulates the logic for network operations, making it 
easier to manage and test network-related functionality.

## Conclusion
This project illustrates the importance of using a ViewModelFactory to initialize ViewModels 
with the necessary dependencies. By following this pattern, you can ensure that your 
ViewModels are properly configured, promoting a clean, maintainable, and testable architecture.
