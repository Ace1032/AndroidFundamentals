# NewsReader
Android
The news Reader is an android application display BBC News on android application. 
This application requests a developer API from BBC News. News Reader app designed with list view front-end, and each row contain with a view. The view contains a news' subject, image and a brief description about the news. The view is clickable. when you click the news' view, it takes to the BBC news original HTML page.    

Future Development 
At the moment, the News Reader works only if there is a network connection. However, in the future, I like to store news on SQLite that way application would be useful even there isn't any network. 
Next step is implementing a search bar. Categorizing news into different section such as sports, politics, etc.
